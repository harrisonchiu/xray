# Module Guide (MG)

This folder contains the Module Guide (MG) for the Chest X-ray project. The MG provides a high-level overview of the system's modular architecture, detailing the decomposition of the system into modules, their responsibilities, and their interactions.

## Key Files
- **MG.tex**: The main LaTeX document for the Module Guide.

## Purpose
The Module Guide serves as a blueprint for the system's architecture, ensuring that the design is modular, maintainable, and scalable. It helps developers and stakeholders understand the system's structure and how its components interact.

It highlights the modular design principles used in the system.

## Key details

1. **Module Decomposition**:
   - Lists all modules in the system and categorizes them based on their responsibilities
   - Describes the "secrets" each module encapsulates to ensure information hiding.

2. **Connection Between Requirements and Design**:
   - Maps functional requirements (FRs) to the modules that implement them.
   - Ensures traceability between the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) and the design.

3. **Use Hierarchy Between Modules**:
   - Describes the dependencies and interactions between modules.
