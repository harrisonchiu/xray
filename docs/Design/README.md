# Design Documents

This folder contains design-related documentation for the Chest X-ray project. It includes both high-level architectural designs and detailed module specifications.

## Subdirectories
- **SoftArchitecture**: High-level software architecture documents (MG).
- **SoftDetailedDes**: Detailed design specifications for individual modules (MIS)

## Purpose
The design documents in this folder aim to:
1. Provide a clear and structured approach to the system's architecture and module design.
2. Ensure traceability between requirements (defined in SRS) and the design.
3. Facilitate development and testing of modules by clearly defining their interfaces and responsibilities.
