\wss{Put your introductory blurb here.  Often the blurb is a brief roadmap of
what is contained in the report.}

\wss{Additional information on the development plan can be found in the

\section{Confidential Information?}

\wss{State whether your project has confidential information from industry, or
not.  If there is confidential information, point to the agreement you have in
place.}

\wss{For most teams this section will just state that there is no confidential
information to protect.}
\section{IP to Protect}

\wss{State whether there is IP to protect.  If there is, point to the agreement.
All students who are working on a project that requires an IP agreement are also
required to sign the ``Intellectual Property Guide Acknowledgement.''}

\section{Copyright License}

\wss{What copyright license is your team adopting.  Point to the license in your
repo.}

\section{Team Meeting Plan}

\wss{How often will you meet? where?}

\wss{If the meeting is a physical location (not virtual), out of an abundance of
caution for safety reasons you shouldn't put the location online}

\wss{How often will you meet with your industry advisor?  when?  where?}

\wss{Will meetings be virtual?  At least some meetings should likely be
in-person.}

\wss{How will the meetings be structured?  There should be a chair for all meetings.  There should be an agenda for all meetings.}

\section{Team Communication Plan}

\wss{Issues on GitHub should be part of your communication plan.}

\section{Team Member Roles}

\wss{You should identify the types of roles you anticipate, like notetaker,
leader, meeting chair, reviewer.  Assigning specific people to those roles is
not necessary at this stage.  In a student team the role of the individuals will
likely change throughout the year.}

\section{Workflow Plan}

\subsection{Version Control}
Git is used as the version control and Github is used to host our repository.

The root branch is \verb|main|. All developers will branch off the \verb|main| branch to work on
issues. Once the work is complete, a pull request is made to merge the changes into \verb|main|.
It must be reviewed and approved by at least one other team member. The pull request must also 
pass any CI tests before it is merged. CI tests include format and build checkers. The \verb|main| 
branch is protected and no one will directly make changes to it.

The naming convention is for branches is \verb|<name>/<short-description-of-change>|. 
Developers may have a couple nested branch folders after their name. Branch names must be all 
lower case letters, numbers, and hyphens. For example, some good branch names are 
\verb|harrison/clean-training-data| and \verb|harrison/docs/srs|. Ideally, each git branch is not 
littered with dozens of sloppy commits and are squashed appropriately.

Git commit messages must be detailed and concise. They must also be grammatically correct, have
correct spelling, and proper capitalization. Each commit must contain one specific change and not 
span multiple (i.e. high cohesion). Nonetheless, they should not be too frequent and atomic which
can lead to an unnecessary mess of commits. In that case, they should be squashed. It is up to 
each member to balance this.

\subsection{Issues}
Github Issues and its Kaban board is used to track progress and assign each member tasks. Each 
issue's topic focuses on one general feature. For example, "Development Plan" or "Clean training 
data" are 2 issues. If "Development Plan" is too large, then it should be split up into sections
(e.g. "Development Plan Section 7-11"). One or more members may be assigned to one issue depending 
on the scope and complexity. This will be discussed in our meetings. Each issue has a short 
description explaining what must be done and why (if needed). New issues are created as necessary
either whenever a new milestone is assigned, when something must be fixed, or when a member
feels like making a new change.

Each ticket is in one of four states:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{To Do:} Tickets that must be done soon but have either not been assigned yet or have not been started.
  \item \textbf{In Progress:} Tickets that have been assigned and the assignee has started working.
  \item \textbf{In Review:} Tickets that are completed and have made a pull request and are waiting for verification.
  \item \textbf{Completed:} Tickets that are completed and have been merged into \verb|main| branch.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{CI/CD}
Github actions will be used to handle any continuous integration and deployment actions. Linters 
and formatters will be used to ensure stylistic standards. It will also auto build certain files to
ensure the changes work. These actions are only done on pull requests trying to merge into 
the \verb|main| branch.


\section{Project Decomposition and Scheduling}

\begin{itemize}
  \item How will you be using GitHub projects?
  \item Include a link to your GitHub project
\end{itemize}

\wss{How will the project be scheduled?  This is the big picture schedule, not
details. You will need to reproduce information that is in the course outline
for deadlines.}

\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}

What is the main risk, or risks, for the success of your project?  What will you
demonstrate during your proof of concept demonstration to convince yourself that
you will be able to overcome this risk?

\section{Expected Technology}

The following technologies will be used by the team to implement the solution.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Frontend Languages}: JavaScript, CSS
\item \textbf{Backend Languages}: Python
\item \textbf{Frontend Libraries}: React
\item \textbf{Backend Libraries}: PyTorch, OpenCV
\item \textbf{Unit Testing}: Pytest
\item \textbf{Linters}: Flake8, Black, Prettier, ESLint
\item \textbf{Continuous Integration and Branch Protection}: GitHub Actions
\item \textbf{Other Software Tools}: git, VSCode
\end{itemize}

\wss{What programming language or languages do you expect to use?  What external
libraries?  What frameworks?  What technologies.  Are there major components of
the implementation that you expect you will implement, despite the existence of
libraries that provide the required functionality.  For projects with machine
learning, will you use pre-trained models, or be training your own model?  }

\wss{The implementation decisions can, and likely will, change over the course
of the project.  The initial documentation should be written in an abstract way;
it should be agnostic of the implementation choices, unless the implementation
choices are project constraints.  However, recording our initial thoughts on
implementation helps understand the challenge level and feasibility of a
project.  It may also help with early identification of areas where project
members will need to augment their training.}

Topics to discuss include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Specific programming language
\item Specific libraries
\item Pre-trained models
\item Specific linter tool (if appropriate)
\item Specific unit testing framework
\item Investigation of code coverage measuring tools
\item Specific plans for Continuous Integration (CI), or an explanation that CI
  is not being done
\item Specific performance measuring tools (like Valgrind), if
  appropriate
\item Tools you will likely be using?
\end{itemize}

\wss{git, GitHub and GitHub projects should be part of your technology.}

\section{Coding Standard}

\wss{What coding standard will you adopt?}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

\wss{Not required for CAS 741}

\input{../Reflection.tex}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Why is it important to create a development plan prior to starting the
    project?
    \item In your opinion, what are the advantages and disadvantages of using
    CI/CD?

\subsection*{External Goals}

\wss{What are your team's external goals for this project? These are not the
goals related to the functionality or quality fo the project.  These are the
goals on what the team wishes to achieve with the project.  Potential goals are
to win a prize at the Capstone EXPO, or to have something to talk about in
interviews, or to get an A+, etc.}

\subsection*{Attendance}

\subsubsection*{Expectations}

\wss{What are your team's expectations regarding meeting attendance (being on
time, leaving early, missing meetings, etc.)?}

\subsubsection*{Acceptable Excuse}

\wss{What constitutes an acceptable excuse for missing a meeting or a deadline?
What types of excuses will not be considered acceptable?}

\subsubsection*{In Case of Emergency}

\wss{What process will team members follow if they have an emergency and cannot
attend a team meeting or complete their individual work promised for a team
deliverable?}

\subsection*{Accountability and Teamwork}

\subsubsection*{Quality} 

\wss{What are your team's expectations regarding the quality
of team members' preparation for team meetings and the quality of the
deliverables that members bring to the team?}

\subsubsection*{Attitude}

\wss{What are your team's expectations regarding team members' ideas,
interactions with the team, cooperation, attitudes, and anything else regarding
team member contributions?  Do you want to introduce a code of conduct?  Do you
want a conflict resolution plan?  Can adopt existing codes of conduct.}

\subsubsection*{Stay on Track}

\wss{What methods will be used to keep the team on track? How will your team
ensure that members contribute as expected to the team and that the team
performs as expected? How will your team reward members who do well and manage
members whose performance is below expectations?  What are the consequences for
someone not contributing their fair share?}

\wss{You may wish to use the project management metrics collected for the TA and
instructor for this.}

\wss{You can set target metrics for attendance, commits, etc.  What are the
consequences if someone doesn't hit their targets?  Do they need to bring the
coffee to the next team meeting?  Does the team need to make an appointment with
their TA, or the instructor?  Are there incentives for reaching targets early?}
