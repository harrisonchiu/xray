\section{Introduction}
\desctotoc{Overview of the Scanalyze Imaging Platform and its intended use by radiologists.}

Welcome to the user guide for the Scanalyze Imaging Platform, an advanced AI-powered tool designed specifically for radiologists. This platform allows medical professionals to upload chest X-ray (CXR) images and receive automated diagnostic support, including disease prediction, comprehensive report generation, and interactive visual analysis tools.

The goal of this platform is to assist radiologists in their workflow by providing accurate, explainable outputs that complement professional clinical judgment. While this tool leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to generate insights, it is intended for use as a decision-support system, not a replacement for a formal radiologic diagnosis.

This guide covers the full range of platform functionality, from account creation and image upload to interpreting AI-generated reports, exploring image findings, and downloading clinical summaries.

\section{Predicted Results and Report of Findings}
\desctotoc{Detailed breakdown of the AI-generated diagnostic report}


After a chest X-ray image is uploaded, the platform automatically performs an AI-based analysis and generates a comprehensive diagnostic report. This report is intended to assist radiologists in interpreting the model's findings with full transparency and interactivity.

\subsection{Report Overview}

Upon completion of the analysis, a completed report is displayed, including the following key components:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Timestamp indicating when the analysis was performed.
    \item A list of predicted findings based on the AI's highest confidence scores.
    \item Detailed medical descriptions of each predicted condition.
    \item A confidence slider to filter results.
    \item A probability distribution table of all considered diseases.
    \item A color-coded heatmap for quick visual interpretation of probabilities.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Confidence Slider}

Located near the top of the report is the Confidence Threshold Slider, allowing users to adjust the minimum probability for a condition to be displayed.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Sliding right filters out lower-confidence predictions and shows only those with high certainty.
    \item This feature allows radiologists to tailor their level of diagnostic confidence based on their clinical context, focusing only on the most probable conditions if desired.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Findings}

Immediately below the confidence slider, the model's most likely conditions are listed under "Findings." These represent the diagnoses with the highest probabilities. For example, in the displayed report, the model has identified Effusion and Edema as the top findings.

\subsubsection*{Description of Predicted Conditions}

Each predicted condition is accompanied by a detailed explanation, which includes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Clinical definition: Explaining what the disease is and its implications (e.g., edema is fluid accumulation often seen in congestive heart failure).
    \item Radiologic description: Highlighting how the disease typically appears on a chest X-ray (e.g., bathing opacities, Kerley B lines, or blunting of the costophrenic angle).
\end{itemize}

These descriptions help radiologists compare the AI findings with their own image interpretation, strengthening the diagnostic decision-making process.

\subsection{Probability Distribution Table}

The system provides a detailed probability distribution of all analyzed disease classes. Each condition is shown with its associated percentage, representing the model's confidence.

\begin{itemize}
    \item This table is sorted to emphasize high-confidence predictions while also revealing lower-likelihood conditions for full transparency.
    \item It is particularly helpful when considering differential diagnoses and diagnosing conditions with low probability.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Heatmap Visualization}

Beneath the probability table, a heatmap view provides a fast and intuitive way to interpret disease probabilities.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Conditions are presented as color-coded boxes, ranging from red (high probability) to green (low probability).
    \item This allows for quick visual assessment of the disease, with higher probability conditions (e.g., Effusion at 66.5\%) shown in red, while less likely ones (e.g., Emphysema at 7.85\%) appear in green.
    \item The heatmap components this numerical data, offering an auto-glance summary that enhances situational awareness.
\end{itemize}

\section{Exploring the CXR Image}
\desctotoc{Interactive features for zooming and dragging the image to explore AI-highlighted findings.}

Once the AI has completed its analysis and generated the report, the original chest X-ray (CXR) image is displayed on the screen. This image viewer is equipped with interactive tools to allow detailed inspection by radiologists.

\subsection{Interactive Tools for Image Exploration}

Radiologists can explore the CXR image using the following built-in tools:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Zoom Functionality: You can zoom in on specific areas of the X-ray for a closer inspection. This is especially helpful when reviewing image findings mentioned in the report, such as observing Kerley B lines, fluid levels, or lung opacities.
    \item Drag-to-Pan: After zooming in, you can click and drag the image to move across different regions of the scan. This allows you to focus on particular anatomical structures or abnormalities in detail, without losing your place.
    \item Responsive Exploration: The viewer responds smoothly to mouse scroll or trackpad pinch gestures for zooming, and click-drag gestures for panning, mimicking a diagnostic workstation experience.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Practical Use}

These interactive tools are designed to support and enhance the interpretation of the report findings. For example:

\begin{itemize}
    \item If the report highlights effusion, the radiologist can zoom in on the lower lung fields or costophrenic angles to confirm fluid levels.
    \item If edema is noted, the upper and mid-lung zones can be inspected more closely for classic patterns such as vascular redistribution or perihilar haze.
\end{itemize}

The goal is to give radiologists the control to visually verify and explore AI-generated predictions within the image itself.
