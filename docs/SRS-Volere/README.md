# Software Requirements Specification (SRS) - Volere Template

This folder contains the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for the Chest X-ray project, following the Volere template.

The other SRS template versions are not used because it would be redundant. This Volere version is the one we chose to use.

## Key Files
- **SRS.tex**: The main LaTeX document for the SRS.
- **Common.tex**: Shared definitions and formatting used across the document.
- **Makefile**: Automates the compilation of the SRS document.

## Purpose
The SRS defines:
- Functional and non-functional requirements.
- System constraints and assumptions.
- Goals and scope of the project.
