\section{Purpose of the Project}

\textbf{Current Content:} The document currently describes an AI tool for analyzing chest X-rays, focusing on assisting radiologists with diagnostic reports.  \\
\\
{\textcolor{blue}{Update Needed:}} We need to revise this section to clearly state that our project is now focused on developing a \textbf{multi-class classification CNN model} that can categorize chest X-ray images into multiple disease types (e.g., pneumonia, tuberculosis, cardiomegaly, normal, etc.). Instead of simply enhancing efficiency for radiologists, our system aims to \textbf{automate and improve the accuracy of chest X-ray disease classification}, providing a structured and interpretable output.\\

\subsection{User Business}
Chest X-rays are essential to the healthcare industry for diagnosing lung and heart conditions. 
However, the interpretation of these images are complex and require a high level of expertise. 
This project intends to tackle this challenge by creating an ai diagnostic tool that analyzes 
chest x-rays and generates medical reports, enhancing efficiency and accuracy in diagnosis. The 
development of this diagnostic tool will lead to the enhancement of patient care and the 
efficiency of the medical industry. 

\subsection{Goals of the Project}
\textbf{Current Content:} The SRS describes a tool that enhances efficiency and accuracy in diagnosis by generating structured reports. \\
\\
{\textcolor{blue}{Update Needed:}} This section should now emphasize our \textbf{multi-class nature of disease classification}, including defining key performance indicators such as \textbf{precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrices, and AUC-ROC scores} to evaluate our model. The goal should also shift from merely assisting radiologists to \textbf{developing an independent AI-based classification system} that can be integrated into medical workflows.\\

The objective of this project is to create a neural network model that can precisely analyze chest 
X-rays and produce diagnostic reports to help radiologists diagnose heart and lung diseases. By 
using this tool, radiologists' workload will be reduced, diagnostic accuracy will increase, and 
workflow efficiency will be improved—all of which will improve patient care. The model's capacity 
to identify diseases with a high degree of accuracy and to drastically cut down on the time and 
effort required for radiologists to generate reports will determine its success. The tool's 
usefulness and efficacy will be assessed using performance metrics and radiologists' input.

\section{Stakeholders}

\textbf{Current Content:} Mentions radiologists, biomedical researchers, AI researchers, and hospitals as key stakeholders. \\
\\
{\textcolor{blue}{Update Needed:}} While stakeholders remain the same, the shift in project focus means that \textbf{medical AI researchers and data scientists} will play a bigger role in validating the classification model. Additionally, \textbf{hospitals and healthcare institutions} that may integrate this model for \textbf{real-time disease detection} should be included as key stakeholders.\\

\section{The Scope of the Work}

\textbf{Current Content:} Describes general project goals. \\
\\
\textbf{\textcolor{blue}{Update Needed:}} Revise to focus on \textbf{multi-class classification improvements}, including \textbf{disease differentiation accuracy and reducing misclassification rates}. Emphasize future \textbf{model adaptation to new disease categories}.

The scope of the work determines the boundaries of the business area to be studied and outlines 
how it fits into its environment. Our project, which focuses on AI-driven chest X-ray analysis, 
aims to create a convolutional neural network (CNN) model that assists radiologists in diagnosing 
lung and heart conditions. The boundaries of the work involve AI-driven diagnostics, healthcare 
applications, and web-based solutions for radiologists.

\subsection{The Current Situation}
The current diagnostic process for chest X-rays is primarily manual. Radiologists analyze images 
to detect abnormalities such as pneumonia, lung cancer, or cardiac conditions. While existing 
automated systems provide some assistance, they lack the accuracy and speed needed to fully 
integrate into a clinical workflow. Errors in diagnosis can occur due to the overwhelming number
of X-rays radiologists must process daily, contributing to diagnostic delays and potential 
misinterpretations. In the current environment, radiologists perform these tasks with limited AI 
assistance, and the process is often time-consuming and subject to human fatigue.

By improving AI-based diagnostic tools, the project aims to reduce the workload of radiologists 
and increase diagnostic accuracy. This involves replacing or augmenting manual processes with an 
advanced CNN model that can provide high-confidence predictions on chest X-rays. The study of the 
current situation allows us to understand the potential effects of such a change and select the 
most effective approach for integration.

The current process can be modeled using a swimlane diagram that outlines the roles of 
radiologists, existing software, and the proposed AI solution. The swimlane diagram would show the 
manual steps involved in diagnosing chest X-rays, including image acquisition, review by the 
radiologist, and final diagnosis, with clear points where automation via the CNN can intervene.


\subsection{The Context of the Work}
The work context diagram shows the interactions between the AI-driven chest X-ray diagnostic tool 
and other adjacent systems. Key external systems include the hospital's radiology information 
system (RIS), the picture archiving and communication system (PACS), and medical imaging databases 
like CheXpert or MIMIC. The product will take input from chest X-ray datasets or directly from 
hospital systems and provide diagnostic outputs to radiologists via a user interface.

Defining the work context helps ensure the AI diagnostic tool integrates seamlessly with existing 
hospital systems, avoiding any disruptions to current workflows. Without understanding these 
systems, the product might fail to meet critical requirements, such as compatibility with existing 
image formats or HIPAA compliance.

A context diagram can be used to map out the interaction between the chest X-ray diagnostic tool 
and the hospital’s RIS/PACS, showing the flow of X-ray data and diagnostic outputs. It would also 
include external AI model training systems and databases used for model validation.


\subsection{Work Partitioning}
The work can be divided into the following key business events, each representing a specific 
response in the diagnostic workflow. Each business use case (BUC) describes how the AI system will 
interact with the radiologists and adjacent systems:

    \item Output: Feedback used to retrain and improve the CNN model.
    \item BUC Summary: The system uses real-world feedback from radiologists to continually 
        improve the model’s performance.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Specifying a Business Use Case (BUC)}

            \item The AI outputs its diagnosis with a corresponding confidence score.
            \item The system flags uncertain or abnormal findings for human review.
        \end{enumerate}
    }
\end{itemize}

This BUC could be represented in multiple ways:

\subsection{Speed and Latency Requirements}
NF-SLR0 The system should generate a chest X-ray image within a reasonable amount of time after a 
request is made.

Rationale: Since the model is generating images based on complex diffusion processes, it should 
still be fast enough to keep users engaged. It should likewise include a loading indicator such 
that the user can interpret how long of a wait there is.

Fit Criterion: A chest X-ray image is generated within 1 minute of the user request.

\subsection{Safety-Critical Requirements}
NF-SCR0 The system should not store or process any personal data unrelated to the generation of 
chest X-ray images.

more than 1 hour of downtime per week).


\subsection{Capacity Requirements}
NF-CR0 The system should only generate one chest X-ray image at a time.

Rationale: Generating a diffusion-based chest X-ray image requires significant processing power 
and time, so the system should focus on producing a single, high-quality image per request.

Fit Criterion: The system will only allow for one image to be generated at a time, with no 
simultaneous image requests.

\subsection{Scalability or Extensibility Requirements}
NF-SER0 The system will be maintained to ensure it continues functioning properly with updates to 
the diffusion model but will not include new features beyond its MVP scope.

Rationale: As an MVP, the system is designed to showcase the core diffusion model. While updates
 to the model will be accommodated, no new features will be added.

 diffusion model, without requiring major redesigns or additional functionality.

\subsection{Longevity Requirements}
NF-LR0 The system should be designed to remain operational and reliable for at least 3 years after 
the initial deployment, or as long as the model and technology is relevant, with minimal 
maintenance required.

Rationale: Since the system is an MVP for research purposes, it should be able to function long 
enough for ongoing experiments and potential further development without requiring constant 
updates or significant maintenance. However, if diffusion models are no longer useful or are no 
longer a research endeavour, the project will more prematurely close.

access and experiment with the diffusion model, so no user restrictions are necessary.

Fit Criterion: The web app can be accessed by anyone without needing to sign in or provide any 
credentials.

\subsection{Integrity Requirements}
NF-IR0 The web app will output the generated chest X-ray image as produced by the diffusion model 
without further data protection or tampering restrictions.

Rationale: The main purpose of the web app is to allow users to experiment with the model and view 
the generated images discussed in the associated research paper. What users do with the images 
afterward is beyond the scope of the system’s responsibility.

Fit Criterion: The web app successfully outputs the generated image without further concern for 
data protection after it is delivered to the user.

\subsection{Standards Compliance Requirements}
NF-SCR0 The chest X-ray images produced by the diffusion model must meet the standards of 
real-world chest X-rays used in radiology.

Rationale: While the web app is for experimentation and exploring the research findings, the 
images generated by the diffusion model must still comply with radiology standards to be viable 
for training models and potential real-world use.

Fit Criterion: The generated chest X-rays meet the quality and standards of actual medical chest 
X-rays used in radiology.

\section{Open Issues}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Data Privacy and Security: Implementation of security measures in order to protect 
    patient information. The data stored should be encrypted and anonymized.
    \item Neural Network Optimization: Accurate models are often large and take a long time to 
    produce output. The performance of the algorithms needs to be optimized in order for the model 
    to be usable for chest x-ray analysis.
    \item Web Application Concurrent Requests: The interface to use the neural network is a web 
    application. There may be multiple instances of the web application from different users to 
    access the same neural network in the backend. It will be difficult to make the model support 
    multiple concurrent users.
    \item Explanation of Disease: Making the model explain why it identifies a disease at a 
    specific location will help transparency and let radiologists make a more informed decision on 
    whether to trust it or if it is a false positive.
\end{itemize}

\section{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}
\subsection{Ready-Made Products}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Pretrained Models: There exists pretrained diffusion models that can generate object 
    images. However, many of them are not specialized in generating chest x-ray images with a 
    specific disease at a specific location. By leveraging these existing pretrained models, we 
    can build on top of their neural networks and improve on it to accelerate development.
    \item Chest X-ray Images Dataset: Established collections of chest x-ray images annotated with 
    radiologist’s report will be used to train the neural network. They need to be used because we 
    have no other source of chest x-ray images.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Reusable Components}
N/A 

\subsection{Products That Can Be Copied}
No products will be copied in place for this project. There are no projects to copy off of since 
this project consists of a research component that will try to improve on existing implementations 
of neural networks in the field. However, this project will produce a neural network model which 
can be copied and used elsewhere for anyone following the license rules.


\section{New Problems}

\textbf{Current Content:} Identifies research gaps. \\
\\
\textbf{\textcolor{blue}{Update Needed:}} Highlight issues such as \textbf{handling multi-label cases where multiple diseases coexist in a single X-ray} and \textbf{model biases based on training data imbalances}.

\subsection{Effects on the Current Environment}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Improvements in neural networks and their ability to identify diseases may lead to an 
    over-reliance on it. Doctors may overly trust the output. It could erode human and traditional 
    skills over time. This will leave healthcare providers less prepared if the model fails, is 
    unavailable, or shows a false positive.
    \item Neural networks do not explain their thoughts. It is a black box. There could be reduced 
    accountability when errors occur as it may be unclear whether the machine or the doctor is at 
    fault.
    \item The diffusion model can generate new chest x-ray images which is great for creating more 
    x-ray datasets. This could be used to further train more chest x-ray neural networks which in 
    turn could improve their ability to identify diseases.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Effects on the Installed Systems}
N/A 

\subsection{Potential User Problems}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Users or doctors may not want to upload chest x-ray images due to privacy concerns.
    \item Users may accidentally upload non chest x-ray images. The neural network model expects 
    an x-ray image and so its output may be unpredictable.
    \item Radiologists may be skeptical that the neural network model works well and will hesitate 
    adopting the technology. Since a diffusion model generates a chest x-ray image that could be 
    used in training other neural networks, radiologists may also be hesitant in using these 
    generated images in their neural networks research.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Limitations in the Anticipated Implementation Environment That May
Inhibit the New Product}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Neural network models usually expect to process one image at a time. Since there is only 
    one model in the backend of the web application, there will be a queue to use the model. This 
    will hinder the workflow as the processes must be done sequentially.
    \item The web application is the interface to use the model. It requires the user to have an 
    internet connection in order to load the site. If the internet connection is poor, the user 
    may have a hard time uploading the image.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Follow-Up Problems}
The web application may store uploaded images. If the encryption for the images is stolen or 
cracked, users may have their medical images exposed. This is a security and privacy concern. 
Users may blame the development team for the lack of security.

\section{Migration to the New Product}
\subsection{Requirements for Migration to the New Product}
N/A. There is no migration. The product is developed from the ground up.

\subsection{Data That Has to be Modified or Translated for the New System}
Training data, which includes pairs of chest x-ray images and radiologist reports, must be 
cleansed so that they can be inputted into the neural network to be trained. Cleansing data could 
involve converting its file type, modifying the images’ shape, and parsing radiologist reports for 
specific words.

\section{Costs}
There are no monetary costs anticipated. All model training will be done locally, so there will be 
no cloud service provider costs. The web application will be hosted locally as well. Should there 
be any costs, the total will not exceed \$500.

\section{User Documentation and Training}

\textbf{Current Content:} Covers basic user guides. \\

    \item \textbf{System Overview:} A high-level description of how the system works from a user’s 
    perspective.
    \item \textbf{Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ):} A list of common issues users may encounter 
    and how to resolve them.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Training Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Minimal Training:} Since the system is user-friendly and mostly automated, 
    minimal training is required.
    \item \textbf{Tutorial Session:} A 1-2 hour training session for medical professionals, 
    focusing on:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item How to use the web application.
        \item How to interpret diagnostic reports and heatmaps.

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete this capstone project?  Examples of possible knowledge
  to acquire include domain specific knowledge from the domain of your
  application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
  computer science knowledge.  Skills may be related to technology, or writing,
  or presentation, or team management, etc.  You should look to identify at
  least one item for each team member.

  To successfully complete the chest x-ray disease identification and image generation project, 
  the team must learn a diverse set of knowledge and skills. The AI/ML developer must be 
  proficient in machine learning techniques. They should especially be knowledgeable in diffusion 
  models and computer vision, and use libraries like PyTorch to build the neural network. They 
  should also understand parameter tuning to enhance model accuracy. A data scientist will focus 
  on data preprocessing and augmentation to increase the training dataset’s variety. Their skills 
  in handling large datasets and using tools like Pandas and NumPy for exploratory analysis are 
  important. The frontend developer should know web development frameworks like React to build an 
  intuitive interface where users can upload x-ray images and view the model’s predictions. The 
  backend developer will need expertise in hosting services locally to run the AI model for the 
  web application. They will ensure it integrates smoothly with the web application. Lastly, the 
  project manager must have strong team management skills. They will ensure the team meets 
  milestones and communicates clearly with stakeholders through presentations and reports. Each 
  team member must combine their technical expertise with effective collaboration to finish the 
  project.

  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?

  To learn the necessary knowledge and skills for the project, team members have several 
  approaches. The AI/ML developer can either complete specialized online courses like Coursera’s 
  deep learning series or review notes from SFWRENG 4ML3 machine learning course. Online courses 
  offers more flexibility learning diffusion models at their own pace. The data scientist can 
  improve their skills through looking at Kaggle projects. Many Kaggle competitions have projects 
  where other people tried to cleanse data from different datasets. The data scientist can 
  practice and follow in their Github’s footsteps to learn from the community. The frontend 
  developer could learn from Youtube tutorials and documentation for frameworks like React. With 
  self-paced tutorials, they can quickly apply their learning in building the interface. The 
  backend developer can either take cloud certifications from AWS or practice hosting a home 
  server which they can connect to at home. A home server is great for learning about networks and 
  how to connect to them. It also gives them options to run whatever service they want. Lastly, 
  the project manager can read project management books like Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the 
  Work in Half the Time. They could also go outside and talk to people to learn how to communicate 
  normally with others in a professional manner.
