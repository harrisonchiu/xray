\section{Purpose of the Project}

\subsection{User Business}
% Feedback addressed: Clarified the project scope by shifting from a generic AI tool to a multiclass CNN model
Chest X-rays are a critical diagnostic tool used by radiologists to identify lung and heart diseases such as pneumonia, cardiomegaly, and pleural effusion. However, manual interpretation of chest X-rays is time-consuming and requires significant expertise, leading to potential diagnostic delays and human error.

The \textbf{Chest Scan} project aims to address these challenges by developing a multiclass convolutional neural network (CNN)-based system capable of classifying multiple diseases from chest X-ray images with high accuracy. Unlike traditional AI-assisted diagnostic tools that focus on binary classification, this system will provide multi-disease classification, confidence scores, and visual heatmap outputs to assist radiologists in decision-making.

By leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, this project aims to enhance diagnostic efficiency, reduce workload on radiologists, and ultimately improve patient care.

\subsection{Goals of the Project}
% Feedback addressed: Made goals measurable, clarified evaluation criteria, added structured report generation and interpretabilit
The objective of this project is to design and implement an AI-powered diagnostic tool that leverages a convolutional neural network (CNN) to analyze chest X-rays and assist radiologists in identifying a wide range of lung and heart conditions. The tool is intended to generate structured diagnostic reports that include relevant clinical information, such as identified diseases and confidence scores, thereby supporting more efficient and accurate medical decision-making.

To enhance interpretability, the system incorporates visual explanation techniques that highlight key regions of interest within the X-ray images, making model outputs more transparent and clinically useful.

Ultimately, this project aims to reduce radiologist workload, improve diagnostic precision, and streamline the medical imaging workflow. The system's effectiveness will be measured through model performance metrics, real-world usability evaluations, and alignment with technical and regulatory standards.

\section{The Scope of the Work}

% Feedback addressed: Context clarified with swimlane and context diagram recommendations. Scope boundaries detailed
The scope of the work determines the boundaries of the business area to be studied and outlines how it fits into its environment. Our project, which focuses on AI-driven chest X-ray analysis, aims to create a convolutional neural network (CNN) model that assists radiologists in diagnosing lung and heart conditions. The boundaries of the work involve AI-driven diagnostics, healthcare applications, and web-based solutions for radiologists.

\subsection{The Current Situation}
The current diagnostic process for chest X-rays is primarily manual. Radiologists analyze images to detect abnormalities such as pneumonia, lung cancer, or cardiac conditions. While existing automated systems provide some assistance, they lack the accuracy and speed needed to fully integrate into a clinical workflow. Errors in diagnosis can occur due to the overwhelming number of X-rays radiologists must process daily, contributing to diagnostic delays and potential misinterpretations. In the current environment, radiologists perform these tasks with limited AI assistance, and the process is often time-consuming and subject to human fatigue.

By improving AI-based diagnostic tools, the project aims to reduce the workload of radiologists and increase diagnostic accuracy. This involves replacing or augmenting manual processes with an advanced CNN model that can provide high-confidence predictions on chest X-rays. The study of the current situation allows us to understand the potential effects of such a change and select the most effective approach for integration.

The current process can be modeled using a swimlane diagram that outlines the roles of radiologists, existing software, and the proposed AI solution. The diagram will detail steps such as image acquisition, radiologist review, and final diagnosis, showing where CNN automation can intervene.

\subsection{The Context of the Work}
The work context diagram shows the interactions between the AI-driven chest X-ray diagnostic tool and other adjacent systems. Key external systems include the hospital's radiology information system (RIS), the picture archiving and communication system (PACS), and medical imaging databases like CheXpert or MIMIC. The product will take input from chest X-ray datasets or directly from hospital systems and provide diagnostic outputs to radiologists via a user interface.

Defining the work context helps ensure the AI diagnostic tool integrates seamlessly with existing hospital systems, avoiding any disruptions to current workflows. Without understanding these systems, the product might fail to meet critical requirements, such as compatibility with existing image formats or HIPAA compliance\cite{hipaa}.

A context diagram will illustrate data flows between the chest X-ray diagnostic tool and RIS/PACS, model training modules, and EHR export systems, reinforcing traceability and regulatory fit.

\section{Open Issues}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Data Privacy and Security: Implementation of security measures in order to protect 
    patient information. The data stored should be encrypted and anonymized.
    \item Neural Network Optimization: Accurate models are often large and take a long time to 
    produce output. The performance of the algorithms needs to be optimized in order for the model 
    to be usable for chest x-ray analysis.
    \item Web Application Concurrent Requests: The interface to use the neural network is a web 
    application. There may be multiple instances of the web application from different users to 
    access the same neural network in the backend. It will be difficult to make the model support 
    multiple concurrent users.
    \item Explanation of Disease: Making the model explain why it identifies a disease at a 
    specific location will help transparency and let radiologists make a more informed decision on 
    whether to trust it or if it is a false positive.
\end{itemize}

\section{Off-the-Shelf Solutions}

% Feedback addressed:
% - Added detail on frameworks, datasets, and libraries used (LO_ExtKnowledge)

\section{New Problems}

\subsection{Effects on the Current Environment}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Improvements in neural networks and their ability to identify diseases may lead to an over-reliance on automated tools. Healthcare professionals may trust outputs without verifying them, which could erode traditional diagnostic skills.
    \item CNN-based models can be difficult to interpret. Without visual explanation tools like Grad-CAM, accountability may be diminished when errors occur.
    \item Biases present in training data (e.g., overrepresentation of certain conditions) may lead to uneven model performance across patient populations.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Effects on the Installed Systems}
N/A

\subsection{Potential User Problems}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Users may hesitate to upload chest X-ray images due to concerns about data privacy and potential breaches.
    \item Non-chest X-ray images may be uploaded by mistake, leading to unreliable outputs from the model.
    \item Some radiologists may be skeptical of AI performance and resist integrating the system into their workflow.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Limitations in the Anticipated Implementation Environment That May Inhibit the New Product}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The system backend currently supports single-image classification at a time. A queue system may be required to support larger volumes.
    \item Dependence on stable internet access may impact usability in lower-bandwidth settings, such as rural hospitals.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Follow-Up Problems}
The system may store uploaded X-ray images. If encryption or server access is compromised, patient images may be leaked. This represents a significant privacy concern and may expose the development team to legal risks.

\section{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning. Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete this capstone project? Examples of possible knowledge
  to acquire include domain specific knowledge from the domain of your
  application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
  computer science knowledge. Skills may be related to technology, or writing,
  or presentation, or team management, etc. You should look to identify at
  least one item for each team member.

  To successfully complete the chest X-ray disease classification and heatmap interpretation project, the team must acquire a range of technical and collaborative skills. The AI/ML developer needs strong knowledge in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), medical image classification, and experience using libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The data scientist must be proficient in preprocessing large imaging datasets (e.g., CheXpert, MIMIC-CXR), statistical data cleaning, and transforming radiology report annotations. The frontend developer should have experience with frameworks such as React and Tailwind CSS to design a clean, professional interface for displaying image uploads, heatmaps, and structured outputs. The backend developer will require expertise in secure API development and integration with the model serving layer, including user authentication and encrypted storage. Finally, the project manager will be responsible for stakeholder communication, timeline coordination, and organizing meetings and documentation. Each team member will combine their respective technical discipline with a collaborative mindset to ensure successful project delivery.

  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill? Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?

  The AI/ML developer will take specialized online courses on CNNs (e.g., fast.ai or DeepLearning.AI on Coursera) and study open-source implementations on GitHub to learn practical model optimization strategies. The data scientist will review Kaggle notebooks involving CheXpert preprocessing and also consult documentation for radiology-specific datasets. The frontend developer will follow the official React and Tailwind CSS documentation alongside YouTube walkthroughs to gain rapid prototyping skills. The backend developer plans to build small API services locally for practice and study role-based access controls via tutorials and open-source Flask/Django projects. The project manager will study Agile project workflows through platforms like Atlassian and supplement this with hands-on scheduling in shared tools like Trello and Slack. This multifaceted learning strategy enables both foundational understanding and immediate project application.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{What went well while writing this deliverable?}
The team developed a much stronger understanding of how to formalize and structure software requirements clearly and thoroughly. Collaborating on the functional and non-functional requirements brought clarity to system expectations and use cases. Using symbolic constants also helped us eliminate ambiguity from our testable metrics. Additionally, cross-referencing requirements with traceability links improved our ability to write modular, maintainable specifications.

\subsection*{What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how did you resolve them?}
Aligning our functional requirements with non-functional requirements while preserving clarity was initially challenging. We often discovered vague phrasing or redundant requirements during peer reviews. To resolve this, we did multiple revision cycles focused on rewriting, scoping, and clearly labeling each requirement. Creating traceability mappings and symbolic constants also required restructuring our LaTeX file, which we resolved by distributing editing tasks by section.

\subsection*{How many of your requirements were inspired by speaking to your client(s) or their proxies (e.g. your peers, stakeholders, potential users)?}
Approximately 70-80\% of our requirements were directly inspired by user needs communicated by stakeholders and informed by proxy conversations with peers and domain experts. Features such as uploading diagnostic images, displaying confidence scores, and visualizing heatmaps originated from feedback during elicitation. Others, like security and audit logging, emerged from inferred expectations around clinical deployment.

\subsection*{Which of the courses you have taken, or are currently taking, will help your team to be successful with your capstone project?}
- \textbf{SFWRENG 3XA3 (Software Requirements)} - Directly influenced the structure and rigor of this deliverable.
- \textbf{SFWRENG 4G06 (Capstone Project)} - Provides end-to-end guidance and iterative planning methodology.
- \textbf{Machine Learning} - Helped us define accuracy, precision, and confidence requirements.
- \textbf{Human-Computer Interaction} - Influenced UI/UX related requirements like clarity, layout, and usability.
- \textbf{Web Programming and Databases} - Enabled us to shape the backend and deployment-related requirements with real-world feasibility in mind.
