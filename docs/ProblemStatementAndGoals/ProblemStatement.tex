\section{Problem Statement}

This section describes the problem that this project aims to solve. It goes over the general
problem, expected inputs and outputs of the project, the environment, and the stakeholders.


\subsection{Problem}

Chest X-rays are one of the most common diagnostic tools for detecting lung and heart conditions.
However, interpreting them accurately requires expertise. Radiologists must examine each x-ray 
carefully. Sometimes they can miss subtle indicators of a disease. Since chest x-rays are taken
for many different reasons, such discovering lung and cardiac conditions or ruling out diseases, 
there is an increasing volume of medical imaging data. This rising number of x-rays leads to
significant delays in diagnosis, overwhelming radiologists which could cause them to make 
mistakes. As a result, the demand for more efficient and reliable diagnostic support grows. A 
neural network designed to process chest x-rays can help radiologists detect conditions, reduce 
diagnostic errors, and provide faster assessments.

\subsection{Inputs and Outputs}

\wss{Characterize the problem in terms of ``high level'' inputs and outputs.  
Use abstraction so that you can avoid details.}

\subsection{Stakeholders}

\subsection{Environment}

\wss{Hardware and software environment}

\section{Goals}

\section{Stretch Goals}

\section{Challenge Level and Extras}

\wss{State your expected challenge level (advanced, general or basic).  The
challenge can come through the required domain knowledge, the implementation or
something else.  Usually the greater the novelty of a project the greater its
challenge level.  You should include your rationale for the selected level.
Approval of the level will be part of the discussion with the instructor for
approving the project.  The challenge level, with the approval (or request) of
the instructor, can be modified over the course of the term.}

\wss{Teams may wish to include extras as either potential bonus grades, or to
make up for a less advanced challenge level.  Potential extras include usability
testing, code walkthroughs, user documentation, formal proof, GenderMag
personas, Design Thinking, etc.  Normally the maximum number of extras will be
two.  Approval of the extras will be part of the discussion with the instructor
for approving the project.  The extras, with the approval (or request) of the
instructor, can be modified over the course of the term.}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
    \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
    \item How did you and your team adjust the scope of your goals to ensure
    they are suitable for a Capstone project (not overly ambitious but also of
    appropriate complexity for a senior design project)?
